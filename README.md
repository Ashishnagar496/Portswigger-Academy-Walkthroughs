# PortSwigger Web Security Academy — Study Notes

## Introduction

This repository contains my personal study notes for labs from the
[PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security).

The focus of these notes is on understanding the **logic and root cause**
of web vulnerabilities, rather than blindly copying payloads.

Each guide generally covers:
1. **Core Concept** — Why the vulnerability exists.
2. **Attack Logic** — How an attacker thinks about exploiting it.
3. **Key Observations** — Important behaviors, mistakes, or patterns.

> ⚠️ These notes are intended for learning and revision, not as a substitute
> for completing labs independently.
